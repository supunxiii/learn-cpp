## Overview

learn-cpp is a code-short note to understand the basics of C++, designed as a simple, code-first learning aid. To learn, users can uncomment the code lines and execute the file to see how each concept works in practice. It briefly covers core theory such as data types, variables, constants, namespaces, type conversions, input handling, operators, control flow, loops, functions, arrays, pointers, recursion, structs, classes, constructors, inheritance, and templates.

## Features

The learn-cpp notes include the following:

1. **Core Types and Variables**

   - Integers, doubles, chars, booleans, and strings
   - Constants and basic assignments

2. **Operators and Conversions**

   - Arithmetic and logical operators
   - Implicit and explicit type conversions

3. **Input and Strings**

   - User input with `std::cin` and `std::getline`
   - String utilities and indexing

4. **Control Flow**

   - If/else and switch statements
   - Ternary operator usage

5. **Iteration**

   - While, do-while, and for loops
   - Nested loops and loop control

6. **Functions and Reuse**

   - Function definitions and overloading
   - Return values and recursion

7. **Arrays and Memory**

   - Arrays and multi-dimensional arrays
   - Pointers, references, and memory addresses

8. **Structures and OOP**

   - Structs and enums
   - Classes, constructors, getters/setters, and inheritance

9. **Templates**

   - Function templates for generic behaviour

## Technologies Used

- **C++23**: Core language used for all examples
- **No External Libraries**: All code uses only standard C++ headers

## Important Notes

- These notes are intended for learning and revision of C++ fundamentals.
- Uncomment only the sections you want to run to avoid conflicting inputs.
- Examples are intentionally minimal to keep the focus on core concepts.
